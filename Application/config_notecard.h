// Amount of time that we should assume that it takes to transmit a request, process it,
// and receive the response, given the type of application running on the sensors.  If,
// for example, many requests or responses are desirable within a given time window,
// then this can be made large.  The downside of making this smaller is that a given
// node will "step on top of" the next sensor's window.  However, sensors do a
// listen-before-talk, which mitigates this to a certain extent.

// The very nature of our protocol is that every message sent from the sensor to the
// gateway, and from the gateway to the sensor, is ACK'ed.  Unfortunately, some
// microcontrollers are not super-fast in rescheduling the MCU after a radio.Send(),
// and there can be a delay between the completion of that send and the issuance
// of the radio.Rx().  As such, we may impose a delay before the radio.Send() to
// increase the probability that the *other side* has gotten to the point where
// there is a radio.Rx() outstanding to "hear" the transmit.
